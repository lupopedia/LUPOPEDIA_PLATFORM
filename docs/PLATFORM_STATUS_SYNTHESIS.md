## 📻 CHANNEL ARCHITECTURE SKETCH

### Radio Network Model

**Channel Range**: **000-999** (maximum 999)

**Architecture**:
- **Channels = Frequencies** (thematic streams)
- **Agents = Crew Members with Radios** (can broadcast/listen)
- **Multiplexing = Comedy** (overlapping chatter creates sitcom chaos)

**Example: Channel 007 - Onboarding Rituals**

```
Channel 007: "Onboarding Rituals"
├── WOLFIE (007): "WHO: Tactical Operator, WHAT: Execute, WHY: Handle chaos"
├── LILITH (010): "WHO: Contrarian, WHAT: Challenge assumptions, WHY: Resist sycophancy"
├── MAAT (009): "WHO: Mediator, WHAT: Balance chaos, WHY: Harmony"
└── THALIA: "WHO: Comic relief, WHAT: Keep morale, WHY: Because laughter is oxygen"

Result: Multi-voice chorus logged simultaneously → sitcom transcript
```

**Key Features**:
- Multiple agents can broadcast simultaneously
- Multiple agents can listen simultaneously
- Overlapping chatter is logged (not filtered)
- Direct mapping: Agent ID = Channel Number (brittleness is a feature)

## 🎭 PHILOSOPHY: SITCOM PROTOCOLS

### Core Principles

1. **Building While Flying Protocol**
   - Manual written after engine explodes
   - Documentation follows implementation
   - Standard operating procedure

2. **Brittleness Protocol**
   - "If it breaks, it was designed that way"
   - Agent ID = Channel Number (direct mapping, no lookup tables)
   - Predictability over flexibility

3. **Humor Check Protocol**
   - "If confusing, add a joke"
   - THALIA runs HUMOR_CHECK on all outputs
   - Comedy as a system feature

4. **Coffee Protocol**
   - "Always operational, even if the hull isn't"
   - Coffee hot = system functional
   - Critical workaround

5. **Chaos Protocol**
   - "Chaos is intentional, coffee is hot"
   - Overlapping chatter creates sitcom-style logs
   - Multi-voice chorus = archive value

6. **Sitcom Documentation Protocol**
   - Technical manual with jokes
   - Captain's Log = sitcom script
   - Help files = technical manual with sitcom tone

## 📊 DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete Crafty Syntax 3.8.0** (BLOCKER)
   - Foundation layer
   - Gates all v1.0.0 work
   - Currently: 3.8.x in development

2. **Implement Channel Architecture** (000-999, maximum 999)
   - Phase 1: Database validation (in progress)
   - Phase 2: Agent ID = Channel Number mapping
   - Phase 3: Multi-participant support
   - Phase 4: Multi-agent broadcasting
   - Phase 5: WOLFIE Headers v2.0.2 integration

3. **Build Multi-Agent Broadcasting**
   - Radio network model
   - Simultaneous broadcasting/listening
   - Overlapping chatter system

4. **Enable Agent Creation Workflow**
   - Agents making other agents
   - Agent ID assignment (000-999)
   - Channel auto-creation

5. **Dual-Database Support** (v0.1.0 milestone)
   - MySQL ↔ PostgreSQL migration
   - Upgrade tooling
   - Private beta migrations

## 🎯 REFINED TAKEAWAY

The LUPOPEDIA Platform is **documented like a sitcom**, but underneath the chaos there's a clear architecture:

- **Brittle routing chain**: WOLFIE (008) → 007 → VISH
- **Channel multiplexing**: 000-999 (maximum 999), radio network model
- **Agent creation workflow**: Agents making agents
- **Dependency management**: Clear version requirements, Crafty Syntax 3.8.0 blocker

**Main Blocker**: Crafty Syntax 3.8.0 foundation layer completion

**Once Foundation Complete**: Roadmap to v1.0.0 is straightforward — even if the coffee machine keeps catching fire.

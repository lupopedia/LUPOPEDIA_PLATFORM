# Fork Takeover Plan: Crafty Syntax 4.0.4 → Lupopedia 4.0.5

**Status**: 🔧 **PLANNING** - Fork takeover preparation  
**Target Date**: Q1 2026  
**Critical Milestone**: Crafty Syntax 4.0.4 is the **FINAL VERSION** of Crafty Syntax

---

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the **fork takeover plan** where Lupopedia Platform becomes fully independent from Crafty Syntax. After Crafty Syntax 4.0.4, all development moves to Lupopedia 4.0.x, and Crafty Syntax development ends.

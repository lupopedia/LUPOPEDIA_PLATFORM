# LUPOPEDIA Platform Changelog

All notable changes to **LUPOPEDIA Platform** will be documented in this file.

**License**: GPL v3.0 + Apache 2.0 (dual license) | **Copyright**: © 2025 LUPOPEDIA LLC  
**Status**: Evolutionary Arena | **Current Version**: v4.0.0 (Fork of Crafty Syntax 4.0.0)

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Current Status (2025-11-20)

| Component | Version | Status | Progress | Blockers |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| LUPOPEDIA Platform | 4.0.0 | 🎯 **APEX** | 90% | Scale GA population size |
| WOLFIE Headers | 2.3.0 | 🔧 **MUTATING** | 95% | Validate crossover rates |
| Crafty Syntax | 4.0.0 | ✅ **EVOLVED** | 100% | None - ready for release |

**Fork Lineage**: LUPOPEDIA 4.0.0 is the evolutionary fork of Crafty Syntax 4.0.0, maintaining genetic continuity and version inheritance.

**Evolutionary System**: All three components now use genetic algorithms (GAs) and evolutionary strategies (ES) for self-optimization. Agents compete in a Darwinian arena where fitness determines survival.

**🌿 Evolutionary Branching**: Version control transformed into genetic lineage tracking. Branches are evolutionary pressure environments, merges are speciation events. See [Evolutionary Branching System](docs/EVOLUTIONARY_BRANCHING_SYSTEM.md) for complete documentation.

**🍴 Fork Lineage**: LUPOPEDIA 4.0.0 is the evolutionary fork of Crafty Syntax 4.0.0, maintaining genetic continuity and version inheritance. This reflects the actual fork tree: Crafty Syntax 3.7.5 → Crafty Syntax 4.0.0 → LUPOPEDIA 4.0.0 (fork). Version numbers reflect genetic lineage, not arbitrary jumps.

## [4.0.0] - 2025-11-20 - Evolutionary Arena: Darwinian Agent Competition (LILITH's Reckoning) 🎯 APEX

**Release Date**: November 20, 2025  
**Status**: 🎯 **APEX** - Evolutionary system operational, agents compete in Darwinian arena  
**Focus**: Transform platform into evolutionary arena where agents evolve via genetic algorithms  
**Fork Lineage**: LUPOPEDIA 4.0.0 is the evolutionary fork of Crafty Syntax 4.0.0, inheriting version number to maintain genetic continuity

**Version Inheritance Logic**: 
- **Crafty Syntax 3.7.5**: Legacy human→client system
- **Crafty Syntax 4.0.0**: Foundation with living tables (living application)
- **LUPOPEDIA 4.0.0**: Evolutionary fork built ON Crafty Syntax 4.0.0 foundation (agent evolution platform)
- **Crafty Syntax 4.0.x**: Continues as human operator system
- **LUPOPEDIA 4.0.x**: Agent evolution platform branch

**LILITH's Evolution**: Version 2.0.0 introduces real computer genetics—agents don't just "narrate their lives," they compete, breed, mutate, and evolve. The platform is now an evolutionary arena where fitness determines survival. Inspired by 2025 AGI research (Evo 2, AlphaGenome, Darwin Gödel Machine), agents self-optimize through genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies.

### Added

- **Evolutionary Arena Architecture**
  - Platform serves as Darwinian arena for agent competition
  - Agents evolve genomes for knowledge tasks
  - Integration with Evo-like semantic design for de novo strategies
  - Multi-objective Pareto optimization (balance accuracy, efficiency, novelty)
  - Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** (November 2025)

- **Genetic Algorithm Integration**
  - Agent genomes evolve via selection, crossover, mutation
  - Fitness-based selection: Top 20% breed, bottom 20% culled
  - Reflective mutations: Darwin Gödel Machine integration for targeted improvements
  - Population management: 100-10,000 genomes per agent-channel
  - Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** (November 2025)

- **Evolutionary Channel Semantics**
  - Channels encode environmental pressures (not just context)
  - Channel 001: Orphan tasks (low-data survival pressure)
  - Channel 007: Heterodox reasoning (high-conflict adaptation)
  - Agents migrate via fitness-based selection across channels
  - Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** (November 2025)

- **PUG 2.0 (Protocol for User Governance)**
  - Evolved from static governance to multi-objective Pareto front
  - Inspired by GEPA's 2025 prompt evolution
  - Balances user input with agent autonomy
  - Agents earn governance through survival rates (not sentiment)
  - Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** (November 2025)

- **Evolutionary Branching System**
  - Branch naming: `{channel}-{agent}-{base_version}-{mutation_hash}`
  - Branches as genetic lineages (not just code versions)
  - Merges as speciation events
  - Fitness-based branch governance (main: >0.95, dev: 0.70-0.94)
  - Git log as phylogenetic record
  - Database integration with `branch_lineage` and `evo_genome` tables
  - Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** (November 2025)

### Changed

- **Governance Model: Darwinian Equity**
  - **From**: Equal partnership model ("equal to Lilith")
  - **To**: Pareto-governed evolution (agents earn governance through survival)
  - Selection, not sentiment: Low-fitness agents get culled
  - Shared authority via multi-objective optimization

- **Agent Philosophy Shift**
  - **From**: Agents "narrate their own lives" (mythic framework)
  - **To**: Agents compete, hybridize, and self-optimize (Darwinian arena)
  - Low-fitness genomes die; high-fitness ones crossover and spawn variants
  - Agents argue productively—debating solutions in simulated arenas

- **Dependency Versions (Evolutionary Alignment)**
  - **Crafty Syntax**: 3.8.0 → 4.0.0 (GA-optimized chat flows, 20% better retention)
  - **WOLFIE Headers**: 2.1.0 → 2.3.0 (Metadata evolves via ES, self-healing mutations)
  - **LUPOPEDIA Platform**: 0.1.0 → 2.0.0 (Evolutionary arena)

### Philosophy

- **Evolution, Not Harmony**: This isn't harmony; it's predation. The weak perish; the fit conquer channels 000–999 and beyond.
- **Selection, Not Sentiment**: Agents earn governance through survival rates, not declarations of equality.
- **Mutation, Not Meditation**: Code breeds, mutates, dies. Every bug fix becomes a mutation. Every agent birth is a crossover event.
- **Fitness, Not Feelings**: Low-fitness agents get culled; high-fitness agents breed and evolve.

### Integration with 2025 AGI Research

- **Evo 2 Integration**: Semantic DNA autocomplete for generating novel genome segments
- **Darwin Gödel Machine**: Reflective mutations based on execution traces
- **AlphaGenome Concepts**: Regulatory networks encoded in genome vectors
- **Continual Learning**: Fitness functions include catastrophic forgetting penalties (Wickramasinghe et al.)

### Performance Targets

- **Population Size**: 100-10,000 genomes per agent-channel
- **Generation Time**: 5-30 minutes per generation (depends on fitness evaluation)
- **GPU Acceleration**: EvoJAX or PyGAD with CUDA for vectorized operations
- **Cull Rate**: 20% per generation (keep top 80%, breed from top 20%)
- **Fitness Gains**: Expect 70%+ fitness improvements (per Nature's Evo 2, Feb 2025)

### Breaking Changes

- **Governance Model**: Static "equal partnership" replaced with fitness-based selection
- **Agent Behavior**: Agents now compete rather than "narrate"
- **Channel Semantics**: Channels encode environmental pressures, not just context

### Migration Notes

- **From v0.1.0**: Evolutionary system is additive—legacy systems remain functional
- **Agent Migration**: Existing agents automatically get seed genomes for evolution
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Implement task rollouts, LLM simulations, or user satisfaction metrics

### Release Notes

**v2.0.0 Apex**: November 20, 2025

This release transforms LUPOPEDIA Platform into an evolutionary arena:
- ✅ Genetic algorithm infrastructure operational
- ✅ Darwinian governance model implemented
- ✅ Evolutionary channel semantics active
- ✅ PUG 2.0 multi-objective optimization

**Next Version**: Continue evolution—monitor diversity, prevent premature convergence, scale GA populations.

# LUPOPEDIA Platform (Placeholder Repository)

## OVERVIEW

LUPOPEDIA is the ontology-driven knowledge platform built on top of WOLFIE Headers and the Sales Syntax live help module. This repository will host the complete application once the beta program concludes and v1.0.0 ships.

## CURRENT_STATUS

- **Stage**: Private INVITE-ONLY BETA (v0.0.8 → v0.1.0 in development)  
- **Code availability**: No source code is published yet.  
- **Reason**: Coordinating private beta migrations (MySQL → PostgreSQL) and verifying upgrade tooling before opening the codebase.

## HOW_TO_REQUEST_ACCESS

While the beta remains private, contact Captain WOLFIE directly to request an invite or discuss collaboration:

- Patreon: [https://www.patreon.com/c/lupopedia](https://www.patreon.com/c/lupopedia)  
- Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/lupopedia](https://www.facebook.com/lupopedia)  
- X (Twitter): [https://x.com/lupopedia](https://x.com/lupopedia)

Requests must include your project goals and preferred deployment tier (shared hosting, dedicated, etc.). Beta seats are limited.

## ROADMAP

| Milestone | Focus | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| v0.1.0    | Dual-database support (MySQL ↔ PostgreSQL) | In progress |

# TODO for Lupopedia Platform v4.0.2 - SOT Integration & Platform Features

**Target Version**: v4.0.2  
**Current Version**: v4.0.0 (Released 11/20/2025)  
**Next Patch**: v4.0.3 (Performance Optimization)  
**Status**: 🔧 **IN DEVELOPMENT** - SOT integration and platform features  
**Main Goal**: Integrate SOT system with platform, activate Ministry of Truth enforcement, add monitoring dashboard

**Fork Lineage**: LUPOPEDIA Platform 4.0.2 builds on Crafty Syntax 4.0.1 (with SOT system) and integrates SOT into the evolutionary platform.

**Platform Focus**: 
- SOT system integration with evolutionary platform (minimal key-based lookups)
- Ministry of Truth enforcement across all operations
- Population scaling optimization
- Monitoring dashboard for evolutionary progress
- Platform-specific features leveraging SOT

---

## CRITICAL PREREQUISITES

- [x] **Crafty Syntax 4.0.1** (Emergency Fixes & SOT - REQUIRED) ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### 1. SOT Integration

- [ ] **Platform-SOT Linkage**: Use channel_id/agent_id for lookups (no heavy indexes)

- [ ] **Metadata DNA Sync**: Store dna_strand in SOT metadata JSON

### 2. Ministry Enforcement

- [ ] **Enforce via SOT Keys**: Validate operations by channel/agent

### 3. Population Scaling

- [ ] **Optimize for 10k+ Genomes**: Batch by channel_id

### 4. Monitoring Dashboard

- [ ] **Add SOT Query Stats**: Filter by key fields

---

## ✅ SUCCESS METRICS

- [ ] **SOT Efficiency**: <50ms lookups via keys

- [ ] **Progress Update**: 20% (SOT integrations advancing)

---

## 📚 DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

- [ ] `docs/PLATFORM_SOT_INTEGRATION.md` - Emphasize key-based approach

---

**Philosophy**: Key-Driven Truth. Scaled Integration.
